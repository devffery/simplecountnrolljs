**Counter and Die Roller**

**Description:**
This project is a web application that combines two interactive elements: a counter and a die roller.

*Counter:*
The counter feature allows users to increment and decrement a numerical value displayed on the screen. Two buttons, labeled "increase" and "decrease", respectively, control the increment and decrement operations. 
The current value of the counter is shown in real-time, providing a visual representation of its state.
The third button, "reset", resets the value of the counter.

*Die Roller:*
The die roller feature simulates rolling a six-sided die. When the "Roll" button is clicked, a random number between 1 and 6 is generated and displayed to the user. 
This functionality mimics the experience of rolling a physical die, providing a fun and interactive element to the application.

Purpose:
This project serves as a simple demonstration of basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript functionalities. 
It showcases how user interactions can be implemented in a web application, allowing users to interact with and manipulate elements on the page dynamically.
